                <u>Beaches</u>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hawaii's beaches are some of the most diverse in the world. Here you can find beaches with white sand, 
                black sand, red sand and even green sand, as well as rocky beaches. Plus, there is even a glass beach 
                on the island of Kauai, a beach with millions of small pieces of so-called sea glass.

                <br>
                With so many beaches along its coastline, a large variety of water activities are possible, including 
                swimming, snorkeling, diving, bodyboarding, surfing, stand-up paddleboarding, windsurfing, kite surfing, 
                kayaking, boating and parasailing. Each beach has something unique to offer.

                <u>Islands</u>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Hawaii is the world’s largest island chain, and it’s the only U.S. state completely made up of islands. 
                    But only 7 of its 132 islands are inhabited: Hawaii (also known as the Big Island), Maui, Molokai, Lanai,
                     Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     The Hawaiian Islands are volcanic islands. They have formed as the Earth’s crust, made up of giant rocky
                      slabs called tectonic plates, moves over a particularly hot spot in the molten layer beneath the crust. 
                      The heat melts the rock that makes up the crust, turning it into magma. Then once the magma breaks through
                       to the surface of the Earth’s crust it cools and forms new land.

                <u>Wildlife</u>
                </h4>
            <p>Though Hawaii has thousands of plants and animals, it has only one native land mammal: the Hawaiian hoary bat. Hawaii’s 
                other mammals, including the mongoose, rat, and feral pig, were brought to the islands by humans.

                Hawaii is teeming with native birds like the pueo (also called the Hawaiian owl), the noio (a type of tern),
                 and Hawaii’s state bird, the nene (it’s related to the Canadian goose). Hawaii’s waters are home to sea life such as 
                 monk seals, hawksbill turtles, and lizardfish. Humpback whales visit the waters from December to May to mate, give birth,
                  and nurture their calves.
